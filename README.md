**🌟 State-of-the-Art Affective Norms Extrapolation with Transformers 🌟**

---

✨ **Description:**

Welcome to our cutting-edge research hub, where we redefine the boundaries of extrapolating affective norms across multiple languages. Using state-of-the-art transformer neural networks, we unlock the profound emotionality of words, serving as an indispensable resource for experimental stimuli selection and in-depth sentiment analysis.

**🔍 Highlights:**

- **🌐 Multi-Lingual Mastery:** We've taken a multi-faceted approach, extrapolating norms for an impressive lineup of languages including English, Polish, Dutch, German, French, and Spanish.

- **🧠 Advanced Transformer Architecture:** Our avant-garde transformer-based neural network architecture stands unmatched in semantic and emotional norms extrapolation, exuding unmatched precision and adaptability for each language.

- **📊 Benchmark Surpassing Results:** Not just setting but elevating the standards, our revolutionary method boasts an average improvement of Δr = 0.1 in correlations with human judgments, overshadowing previous approaches.

- **🛠️ Next-Gen Stimuli Selection:** Venturing into uncharted territory, we unveil a pioneering, unsupervised stimuli selection method, ensuring words of profound semantic resonance are handpicked.

- **💻 Researcher's Web Tool Access:** While our main emphasis remains on the transformative models, we also provide a web application tool for researchers, serving as a practical touchpoint for direct extrapolation.
